# SkyMail3k
SkyMail3k is an interactive, multilevel game that was created in Java and uses the Java SDK CodenameOne. 
It allows the user to interact with the game objects throught either the keyboard or on screen controls.
It offers sound to keep the player engaged, and a scoreboard that shows several different player stats.
I have another repo on my github that contains a downloadable jar file if you would like to play it on deskop.
